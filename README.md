Food delivery services have long ceased to be just couriers who deliver orders. The e-grocery industry is rapidly moving towards accumulating and utilizing big data to know more about its users and provide higher-quality and more personalized services. One step towards such personalization can be the development of a model that understands user habits and needs and, for example, can guess what and when the user will want to order next.

Such a model, once developed, can bring significant value to the customer - saving time when assembling a shopping cart, helping not to forget anything in the order, eliminating the need to plan purchases, and keeping track of dwindling stocks of products.

In this competition, participants are invited to solve the task of predicting the next order of a user (regardless of the specific moment in time when this order will occur). A user's order consists of a list of unique product categories, regardless of how many products of each category they have taken.

| Multilabel Purchases | The task of predicting the next order of a user is proposed (regardless of the specific moment in time when this order will occur). A user's order consists of a list of unique product categories, regardless of how many products of each category they have taken. This project utilizes a fully connected feed-forward neural network. | *matplotlib, numpy, pandas, tensorflow, tqdm, scikit-learn* |
